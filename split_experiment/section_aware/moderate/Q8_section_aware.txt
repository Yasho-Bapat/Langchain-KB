Question: Outline everything that happens when 341D catches fire. Also mention what to do afterwards.
Answer:  Answer: Flammable vapors may accumulate in confined spaces. Vapors may form an explosive mixture with air. Vapors can travel to a source of ignition and flash back. Will burn if involved in a fire. Flammable Liquid. Can release vapors that form explosive mixtures at temperatures above the flashpoint. Use water spray to keep fire-exposed containers cool. Containers may explode in the heat of a fire. For small fires, use dry chemical, carbon dioxide, water spray or alcohol-resistant foam. For large fires, use water spray, fog, or alcohol-resistant foam. Use water spray to cool fire-exposed containers. Water may be ineffective. Do NOT use straight streams of water. After the fire, absorb spill with inert material (e.g. vermiculite, sand or earth), then place in suitable container. Remove all sources of ignition. Use a spark-proof tool. Provide ventilation. A vapor suppressing foam may be used to reduce vapors. Ventilate area of leak or spill. Cover spill with a 1:1:1 mixture by weight of Sodium Carbonate or Calcium Carbonate, clay and sand. Scoop mixture into a plastic container and, in the fume hood, add to a pail of cold water. Neutral
