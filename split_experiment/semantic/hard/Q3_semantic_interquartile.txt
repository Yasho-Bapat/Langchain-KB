Hazardous Material Identification System (HMIS® III) hazard ratings are designed to inform employees of chemical hazards \nin the workplace. These ratings ar e based on the inherent properties of the material under expected conditions of normal use \nand are not intended for use in emergency situations. HMIS® III ratings are to be used with a fully implemented HMIS® III \nprogram. HMIS® is a registered mark of the American Coatings Association (ACA).

For complete assessment, when determining the degree of hazard, the material \nbeing abraded must also be considered. This product contains titanium dioxide. Cancer of the lungs has been observed in rats that inhale d high levels of titanium \ndioxide. No exposure to inhaled titanium dioxide is expected during the normal handling and use of this product. Titanium \ndioxide w as not detected when air sampling was conducted during simulated use of similar products containi ng titanium \ndioxide. Therefore, the health effects associated with titanium dioxide are not expected during the normal use of this produc t.
