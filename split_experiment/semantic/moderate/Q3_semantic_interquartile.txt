Question: Evaluate the environmental impact of Citrisurf when released in large quantities.
Answer:  

Citrisurf is toxic to aquatic life and should be avoided from being released into the environment. The product is not biodegradable and has no data on the rates of the processes that could occur when spilled on land. It is likely to volatilize and biodegrade when released into water. The fate of the product in groundwater is unknown. It is not expected to adsorb to sediment or bioconcentrate in fish. When released to the atmosphere, it will photodegrade in hours to an estimated range of 4 to 6 days in less polluted areas. Rainout should be significant.
