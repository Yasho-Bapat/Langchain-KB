Question: Outline everything that happens when 341D catches fire. Also mention what to do afterwards.
Answer: [" Answer: Use a fire fighting agent suitable for ordinary combustible material such as water or foam to extinguish. Exposure to extreme heat can give rise to thermal decomposition. Hazardous Decomposition or By-Products Substance Condition Carbon monoxide During Combustion Carbon dioxide During Combustion Hydrogen Fluoride During Combustion When fire fighting conditions are severe and total thermal decomposition of the product is possible, wear full protective clothing, including helmet, self-contained, positive pressure or pressure demand breathing apparatus, bunker coat and pants, bands around arms, waist and legs, face mask, and protective covering for exposed areas of the head. As a disposal alternative, incinerate in a permitted waste incineration facility. Proper destruction may require the use of additional fuel during incineration processes. Combustion products will include halogen acid (HCl/HF/HBr). Facility must be capable of handling halogenated materials.

For industrial or professional use only. Do not use in a confined area with \nminimal air exchange. Avoid breathing of dust created by sanding, grinding or machining. Damaged product can break apart \nduring us e and cause serious injury to face or eyes. Check product for damage such as cracks or nicks prior to use. Replace if \ndamaged. Always wear eye and face protection when working at sanding or grinding operations or when near such \noperations. Avoid release t o the environment. Combustible dust may form by action of this product on another material \n(substrate). Dust generated from the substrate during use of this product may be explosive if in sufficient concentration wi th \nan ignition source. Dust deposits should not be allow ed to accumulate on surfaces because of the potential for secondary \nexplosions. 7.2.
