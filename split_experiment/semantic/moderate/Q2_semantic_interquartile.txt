Question: What equipment is recommended while manufacturing scotch brite and what care should be taken while handling the involved material?
Answer:  

Answer: For industrial or professional use only. Avoid breathing of dust created by sanding, grinding or machining. Combustible dust may form by action of this product on another material (substrate). Dust generated from the substrate during use of this product may be explosive if in sufficient concentration with an ignition source. Dust deposits should not be allowed to accumulate on surfaces because of the potential for secondary explosions. Store in tightly closed container. Store in a well-ventilated place. Store away from incompatible materials (see Section 10 of the SDS). Wear appropriate personal protective equipment (see Section 8). Use only with adequate ventilation. Avoid breathing dust. Read the Safety Data Sheet of the material you are grinding, polishing, cutting, sanding, etc. for appropriate respiratory protection. Wash hands after handling. Bonded Abrasive products should be stored according to ANSI B7.1 and not be exposed to extreme temperatures or conditions that cause condensation. Coated Abrasive products should be stored according to ANSI B7.7 and between 35-50% relative humidity and between 60-80 degrees Fahrenheit. Always inspect products for cracks, chips, nicks and for possible damage before mounting and ring test vitrified wheels. Damaged product can break apart during use
