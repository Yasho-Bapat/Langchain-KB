Question: What equipment is recommended while manufacturing scotch brite and what care should be taken while handling the involved material?
Answer: [' Answer: Provide appropriate local exhaust ventilation for sanding, grinding or machining. Use general dilution ventilation and/or local exhaust ventilation to control airborne exposures to below relevant Exposure Limits and/or control dust/fume/gas/mist/vapors/spray. If ventilation is not adequate, use respiratory protection equipment. Provide local exhaust at process emission sources to control exposure near the source and to prevent the escape of dust into the work area. Ensure that dust-handling systems (such as exhaust ducts, dust collectors, vessels, and processing equipment) are designed in a manner to prevent the escape of dust into the work area (i.e., there is no leakage from the equipment ). To minimize the risk of injury to face and eyes, always wear eye and face protection when working at sanding or grinding operations or when near such operations. Select and use eye/face protection to prevent contact based on the results of an exposure assessment. The following eye/face protection(s) are recommended: Safety Glasses with side shields. Wear appropriate gloves to minimize risk of injury to skin from contact with dust or physical abrasion from grinding or sanding. Assess exposure concentrations of all materials involved in the work process. Consider material being abraded when determining the appropriate respiratory protection. Select and use appropriate respir', ["../docs/4.1_3M Scotch Brite SDS Sheet.pdfHyg. : American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists\nAmerican I ndust.

Avoid breathing of dust created by sanding, grinding or machining. Combustible dust \nmay form by action of this product on another material (substrate). Dust generated from the substrate during use of this \nproduct may be explosive if in sufficient concentration with an ignition source. Dust deposits should not be allow ed to \naccumulate on surfaces because of the potential for secondary explosions. 7.2. Conditions for safe storage including any incompatibilities\nNo special storage requirements. SECTION 8: Exposure controls/personal protection\n8.1.
