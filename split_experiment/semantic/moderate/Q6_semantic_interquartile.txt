Question: If I live in Quebec, how much aluminum oxide can I come in contact with? What do I do if it accidentally goes into my eyes?
Answer: [' Answer: You can come in contact with 10 mg/m3 of aluminum oxide. If it accidentally goes into your eyes, rinse cautiously with water for several minutes. Remove contact lenses, if present and easy to do. Continue rinsing.<|im_end|>', ['../docs/4.1 SDS Norton wheel 3.032 X .375 X 1-14 66253249782.pdfEXPOSURE GUIDELINES: \nIngredient Guideline OSHA Guideline NIOSH Guideline ACGIH Quebec Canada Ontario Canada \nAluminum Oxide,\nNon-fibrous  PEL-TWA: 5 mg/m3\nRespirable fraction (R)\nPEL-TWA: 15 mg/m3\nTotal particulate/dust\n(T)  TLV-TWA: 10 mg/m3  VEMP-TWA: 10\nmg/m3 Total\nparticulate/dust (T) OEL-TWAEV: 10\nmg/m3 Total\nparticulate/dust (T)\nAmorphous Silica,\nFused  OSHA PEL-TWA 0.1\nmg/m3 REL-TWA: 0.05\nmg/m3 (Respirable) ACGIH TLV-TWA 0.1\nmg/m3 VEMP-TWA: 0.1\nmg/m3 Respirable\nfraction (R) OEL-TWAEV: 0.1\nmg/m3 Respirable\nfraction (R)\nIngredient Alberta Canada Mexico British Columbia\nCanada \nAluminum Oxide,\nNon-fibrous  OEL-TWA: 10 mg/m3  MPE-PPT: 0.1 mg/m3\nRespirable fraction (R) OEL-TWA: 3 mg/m3\nRespirable fraction (R)\nOEL-TWA: 10 mg/m3 \nOEL-TWA: 10 mg/m3\nTotal particulate/dust\n(T)\nOEL-STEL: 20 mg/m3\nTotal particulate/dust\n(T)\nAmorphous Silica,\nFused  OEL-TWA: 0.1 mg/m3\nRespirable fraction (R) MPE-PPT: 0.1 mg/m3\nRespirable fraction (R) \nAppropriate engineering controls: \nEngineering Controls: Use appropriate engineering control such as process enclosures, local exhaust ventilation, or other\nengineering controls to control airborne levels below recommended exposure limits.

Damaged product can break apart \nduring us e and cause serious injury to face or eyes. Check product for damage such as cracks or nicks prior to use. Replace if \ndamaged. Always wear eye and face protection when working at sanding or grinding operations or when near such \noperations. Avoid release t o the environment.
