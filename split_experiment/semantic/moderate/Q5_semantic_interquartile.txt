Precautions for safe handling\nFor industrial or professional use only. Avoid breathing of dust created by sanding, grinding or machining. Combustible dust \nmay form by action of this product on another material (substrate). Dust generated from the substrate during use of this \nproduct may be explosive if in sufficient concentration with an ignition source. Dust deposits should not be allow ed to \naccumulate on surfaces because of the potential for secondary explosions. 7.2.
