Question: What are the hazards associated with 341D Belts?
Answer: [' Answer: Not classified as hazardous according to OSHA Hazard Communication Standard, 29 CFR 1910.1200. Dust from grinding, sanding or machining may cause irritation of the respiratory system. Signs/symptoms may include cough, sneezing, nasal discharge, headache, hoarseness, and nose and throat pain. Mechanical Skin irritation: Signs/symptoms may include abrasion, redness, pain, and itching. Mechanical eye irritation: Signs/symptoms may include pain, redness, tearing and corneal abrasion. Dust created by grinding, sanding, or machining may cause eye irritation. Signs/symptoms may include redness, swelling, pain, tearing, and blurred or hazy vision. Exposure to extreme heat can give rise to thermal decomposition. Hazardous Decomposition or By-Products: Carbon monoxide During Combustion, Carbon dioxide During Combustion, Hydrogen Fluoride During Combustion. Dust deposits should not be allowed to accumulate on surfaces because of the potential for secondary explosions. Avoid release to the environment. Combustible dust may form by action of this product on another material (substrate). Dust generated from the substrate during use of this product may be explosive if in sufficient concentration with an ignition source', ["../docs/31.1 SDS_3M Abrasive Products, 341D Belts.pdf3M™Abrasive Products, 341D Belts    03/14/14\n__________________________________________________________________________________________\n  Page  10 of    10the toxic properties of combustion or decomposition products that are known to be generated in significant quantities.

For complete assessment, when determining the degree of hazard, the material \nbeing abraded must also be considered. This product contains titanium dioxide. Cancer of the lungs has been observed in rats that inhale d high levels of titanium \ndioxide. No exposure to inhaled titanium dioxide is expected during the normal handling and use of this product. Titanium \ndioxide w as not detected when air sampling was conducted during simulated use of similar products containi ng titanium \ndioxide. Therefore, the health effects associated with titanium dioxide are not expected during the normal use of this produc t.
