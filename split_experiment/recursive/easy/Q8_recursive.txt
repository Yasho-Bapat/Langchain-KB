Specific hazards arising from\nthe chemical\nSelf-contained breathing apparatus and full protective clothing must be worn in case of fire. Special protective equipment\nand precautions for firefighters\nMove containers from fire area if you can do so without risk. Fire fighting\nequipment/instructions\nUse standard firefighting procedures and consider the hazards of other involved materials. Specific methods\nNo unusual fire or explosion hazards noted. General fire hazards\n6. Accidental release measures\nKeep unnecessary personnel away. Wear appropriate protective equipment and clothing during\nclean-up. Use a NIOSH/MSHA approved respirator if there is a risk of exposure to dust/fume atlevels exceeding the exposure limits. For personal protection, see section 8 of the SDS.Personal precautions,\nprotective equipment andemergency procedures\nAvoid the generation of dusts during clean-up. Collect dust using a vacuum cleaner equipped with\nHEPA filter. Stop the flow of material, if this is without risk.\nLarge Spills: Wet down with water and dike for later disposal. Shovel the material into waste\ncontainer. Following product recovery, flush area with water.\nSmall Spills: Sweep up or vacuum up spillage and collect in suitable container for disposal. For\nwaste disposal, see section 13 of the SDS.Methods and materials for\ncontainment and cleaning up\nAvoid discharge into drains, water courses or onto the ground.
