A void runoff into storm sewers and ditches which lead to waterways. \nFollow all governm ent regulations.\nSECTION V II - HAN DLING A ND STORA GE\nHandling:  Wash thoroughl y after handling.  Do not  get into eyes, on s kin or on c lothing.\nStorag e:  Keep container closed when not  in use.  Store in corrosion resistant containers.  Store away from\nincom patible materials.  Aqueous s olutions of citric acid can,  if in con tact with reactive m etals (iron, zinc,\naluminum), over a per iod of time form hydrogen -  an ext remely flammable gas .  Store und er a cont rolled\nenvironm ent.  Avoid excessive heat.  Keep from freezing.\nSECTION V III - EXPOSURE CON TROL S/PERSONA L PROT ECTION\nEngineering  Controls :  Good ge neral ventilation shoul d be sufficient to control airborne levels.  Facilities storing or\nutilizing this m aterial sh ould be equipped with an eyewash facility and a sa fety shower.\nRespiratory Pr otection:  A respiratory protection program that meets OSHA 1910.134 and ANSI Z88.2\nrequi rements must be f ollowed w henever workpl ace cond ition warrant a respiratorâ€™s use.\nSkin Pr otection:  Rubber, neoprene o r polyvinyl chloride imperviou s glov es m ay provide protect ion against\npermeation.  Gloves of other chemically resistant materials may not  provide adequate protection.  Consul t your  glove\nmanufacturer for compatibilities.\nEye Protection:  Wear chemical splash goggles.  DO  NOT W EAR CONTACT LEN SES.\nOther Protective Equipment:  Wear s uitable protect ive clothing to minimize an d/or preven t contact.  An eye-wash\nand safety shower should be present in the immediate area when handling this product.\nHygienic Practices:  Wash hands before eating.  Remove contaminated clothing and wash before reuse.  Use only in\nwell ventilated area.  Follow all MSDS/label precautions even after containers are emptied because they may retain\nproduc t residues.  Avoid contact with eyes, skin and clothing.', '../docs/4.1 SDS Norton wheel 3.032 X .375 X 1-14 66253249782.pdfIngestion: May be harmful if swallowed.
