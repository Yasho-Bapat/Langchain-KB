Question: What is the UN number assigned to Ethyl Alcohol for transport purposes?
Answer: [' \\nAnswer: UN1170.<|im_end|>', ['../docs/3.1 Ethyl_Alcohol_Material Safety Data Sheet.pdf24.3Â°CFish: Rainbow trout: LC50 = 11200 mg/L; 24 Hr; Fingerling (Unspecified)Bacteria: \nPhytobacterium phosphoreum: EC50 = 34900 mg/L; 5 -30 min; Microtox test When spilled \non land it is apt to volatilize, biodegrade, and leach into the ground water, but no data on \nthe rates of these processes could be found. Its fate in ground water is unknown. When \nreleased into water it will volatilize and probably biodegrade. It would not be expected t o \nadsorb to sediment or bioconcentrate in fish.  \nEnvironmental:  When released to the atmosphere it will photodegrade in hours (polluted \nurban atmosphere) to an estimated range of 4 to 6 days in less polluted areas. Rainout \nshould be significant.  \nPhysical:  No information available.  \nOther:  No information available.  \nSection 13 - Disposal Considerations  \n \nChemical waste generators must determine whether a discarded chemical is classified as a \nhazardous waste. US EPA guidelines for the classification determinati on are listed in 40 CFR \nParts 261.3. Additionally, waste generators must consult state and local hazardous waste \nregulations to ensure complete and accurate classification.  \nRCRA P -Series:  None listed.  \nRCRA U -Series:  None listed.  \nSection 14 - Transport Info rmation  \n \n US DOT  Canada TDG  \nShipping Name:  ETHANOL  No information available.  \nHazard Class:  3  \nUN Number:  UN1170   \nPacking Group:  II  \n \nSection 15 - Regulatory Information  \n \nUS FEDERAL  \n \nTSCA  \n     CAS# 64 -17-5 is listed on the TSCA inventory.  \n     CAS# 7732 -18-5 is listed on the TSCA inventory.  \nHealth & Safety Reporting List  \n     None of the chemicals are on the Health & Safety Reporting List.  \nChemical Test Rules', '../docs/3.1 Ethyl_Alcohol_Material Safety Data Sheet.pdfMaterial Safety Data Sheet  \nEthyl alcohol  \nACC# 91467  \nSection 1 - Chemical Product and Company Identification  \nMSDS Name:  Ethyl alcohol  \nCatalog Numbers:  A997-1GAL, A997 -1PT, A997 -55GAL, A997 -5GAL  \nSynonyms:  Ethyl alcohol; Ethyl hydroxide; Fermentation alcohol; Grain alcohol; \nMethylcarbinol.  \nCompany Identification:  \n              Fisher Scientific  \n              1 Reagent Lane  \n              Fair Lawn, NJ 07410  \nFor information, call:  201-796-7100 \nEmergency Number : 201-796-7100 \nFor CHEMTREC assistance, call:  800-424-9300 \nFor International CHEMTREC assistance, call:  703-527-3887 \nSection 2 - Composition, Information on Ingredients  \n \nCAS#  Chemical Name  Percent  EINECS/ELINCS  \n64-17-5 Ethyl alcohol  95-99 200-578-6 \n7732-18-5 Water  1-5 231-791-2 \n \nSection 3 - Hazards Identification  \n \nEMERGENCY OVERVIEW  \nAppearance: colorless clear liquid.
