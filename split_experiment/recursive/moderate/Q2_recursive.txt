Question: What equipment is recommended while manufacturing scotch brite and what care should be taken while handling the involved material?
Answer: [' Answer: Provide appropriate local exhaust ventilation for sanding, grinding or machining.  Use general dilution ventilation and/or local exhaust ventilation to control airborne exposures to below relevant Exposure Limits and/or control dust/fume/gas/mist/vapors/spray. If ventilation is not adequate, use respiratory protection equipment.  Provide local exhaust at process emission sources to control exposure near the source and to prevent the escape of dust into the work area.  Ensure that dust-handling systems (such as exhaust ducts, dust collectors, vessels, and processing equipment) are designed in a manner to prevent the escape of dust into the work area (i.e., there is no leakage from the equipment ). Wear appropriate gloves to minimize risk of injury to skin from contact with dust or physical abrasion from grinding or sanding. Assess exposure concentrations of all materials involved in the work process.  Consider material being abraded when determining the appropriate respiratory protection.  Select and use appropriate respirators to prevent inhalation overexposure.  An exposure assessment may be needed to decide if a respirator is required.  If a respirator is needed, use respirators as part of a full respiratory protection program.  Based on the results of the exposure assessment, select from the following respirator type', ['../docs/4.1_3M Scotch Brite SDS Sheet.pdf3M™Scotch -Brite ™Products,  7447, 7467, General Purpose Pads    02/24/14\n__________________________________________________________________________________________\nPage  3of    10Oxides of Nitrogen During Combustion\n5.3.
