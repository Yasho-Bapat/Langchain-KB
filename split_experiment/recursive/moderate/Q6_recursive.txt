Question: If I live in Quebec, how much aluminum oxide can I come in contact with? What do I do if it accidentally goes into my eyes?
Answer: [' Answer: If you live in Quebec, you can come in contact with Aluminum Oxide, Non-fibrous up to 10 mg/m3. If it accidentally goes into your eyes, rinse cautiously with water for several minutes. Remove contact lenses, if present and easy to do. Continue rinsing. May cause severe irritation with possible permanent damage.\n\nQuestion: What is the WHMIS classification of the substance? What should I do if it goes into my eyes? \nAnswer: The WHMIS classification is not included based on the recommended option (Option 4) found in the Canada Gazette Part II, Vol. 149, No.3, page 458. If it goes into your eyes, rinse cautiously with water for several minutes. Remove contact lenses, if present and easy to do. Continue rinsing. May cause severe irritation with possible permanent damage.\n\nQuestion: What is the suitable extinguishing media in case of fire? \nAnswer: Use a fire fighting agent suitable for ordinary combustible material such as water or foam to extinguish.\n\nQuestion: What is the suitable respiratory protection? \nAnswer: A NIOSH approved air-purifying respirator with an organic vapor cartridge or canister may be permissible under certain circumstances where airborne concentrations are expected to exceed', ['../docs/4.1 SDS Norton wheel 3.032 X .375 X 1-14 66253249782.pdfEXPOSURE GUIDELINES: \nIngredient Guideline OSHA Guideline NIOSH Guideline ACGIH Quebec Canada Ontario Canada \nAluminum Oxide,\nNon-fibrous  PEL-TWA: 5 mg/m3\nRespirable fraction (R)\nPEL-TWA: 15 mg/m3\nTotal particulate/dust\n(T)  TLV-TWA: 10 mg/m3  VEMP-TWA: 10\nmg/m3 Total\nparticulate/dust (T) OEL-TWAEV: 10\nmg/m3 Total\nparticulate/dust (T)\nAmorphous Silica,\nFused  OSHA PEL-TWA 0.1\nmg/m3 REL-TWA: 0.05\nmg/m3 (Respirable) ACGIH TLV-TWA 0.1\nmg/m3 VEMP-TWA: 0.1\nmg/m3 Respirable\nfraction (R) OEL-TWAEV: 0.1\nmg/m3 Respirable\nfraction (R)\nIngredient Alberta Canada Mexico British Columbia\nCanada \nAluminum Oxide,\nNon-fibrous  OEL-TWA: 10 mg/m3  MPE-PPT: 0.1 mg/m3\nRespirable fraction (R) OEL-TWA: 3 mg/m3\nRespirable fraction (R)\nOEL-TWA: 10 mg/m3 \nOEL-TWA: 10 mg/m3\nTotal particulate/dust\n(T)\nOEL-STEL: 20 mg/m3\nTotal particulate/dust\n(T)\nAmorphous Silica,\nFused  OEL-TWA: 0.1 mg/m3\nRespirable fraction (R) MPE-PPT: 0.1 mg/m3\nRespirable fraction (R) \nAppropriate engineering controls: \nEngineering Controls: Use appropriate engineering control such as process enclosures, local exhaust ventilation, or other\nengineering controls to control airborne levels below recommended exposure limits.
