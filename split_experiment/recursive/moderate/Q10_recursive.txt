May cause painful sensitization to light. May cause \nchemical conjunctivitis and corneal damage.  \nSkin:  Causes moderate skin irritation. May cause cyanosis of the extremities.  \nIngestion:  May cause gastrointestinal irritation with nausea, vomiting and diarrhea. May \ncause systemic toxicity with acidosis. May cause central nervous system depression, \ncharacteriz ed by excitement, followed by headache, dizziness, drowsiness, and nausea. \nAdvanced stages may cause collapse, unconsciousness, coma and possible death due to \nrespiratory failure.  \nInhalation:  Inhalation of high concentrations may cause central nervous syst em effects \ncharacterized by nausea, headache, dizziness, unconsciousness and coma. Causes \nrespiratory tract irritation. May cause narcotic effects in high concentration. Vapors may \ncause dizziness or suffocation.  \nChronic:  May cause reproductive and fetal e ffects. Laboratory experiments have resulted in \nmutagenic effects. Animal studies have reported the development of tumors. Prolonged \nexposure may cause liver, kidney, and heart damage.  \nSection 4 - First Aid Measures  \n \n \nEyes:  Get medical aid. Gently lift e yelids and flush continuously with wate r.  \nSkin:  Get medical aid. Wash clothing before reuse. Flush skin with plenty of soap and \nwater.  \nIngestion:  Do not induce vomiting. If victim is conscious and alert, give 2 -4 cupfuls of milk \nor water. Never give anyth ing by mouth to an unconscious person. Get medical aid.  \nInhalation:  Remove from exposure and move to fresh air immediately. If not breathing, \ngive artificial respiration. If breathing is difficult, give oxygen. Get medical aid. Do NOT use \nmouth -to-mouth re suscitation.  \nNotes to Physician:  Treat symptomatically and supportively. Persons with skin or eye \ndisorders or liver, kidney, chronic respiratory diseases, or central and peripheral nervous \nsytem diseases may be at increased risk from exposure to this subs tance.  \nAntidote:  Replace fluid and electrolytes.  \nSection 5 - Fire Fighting Measures  \n \n \nGeneral Information:  Replace fluid and electrolytes. As in any fire, wear a self -contained \nbreathing apparatus in pressure -demand, MSHA/NIOSH (approved or equivalent), and full \nprotective gear. Vapors may form an explosive mixture with air. Vapors can travel to a \nsource of ignition and flash back. Will burn if involved in a fire. Flammable Liquid. Can \nrelease vapors that form explosive mixtures at temperatures above the flashpoint. Use \nwater spray to keep fire -exposed containers cool. Containers may explode in the heat of a \nfire. \nExtinguishing Media:  For small fires, use dry chemical, carbon dioxide, water spray or \nalcohol -resistant foam. For large fires, use water spray,  fog, or alcohol -resistant foam. Use \nwater spray to cool fire -exposed containers. Water may be ineffective. Do NOT use straight \nstreams of water.  \nFlash Point:  16.6 deg C ( 61.88 deg F)']]
