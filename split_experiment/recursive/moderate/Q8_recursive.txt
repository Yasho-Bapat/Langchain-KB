Question: Outline everything that happens when 341D catches fire. Also mention what to do afterwards.
Answer: [' Answer: When 341D catches fire, use a fire fighting agent suitable for ordinary combustible material such as water or foam to extinguish. Exposure to extreme heat can give rise to thermal decomposition. Hazardous Decomposition or By-Products include Carbon monoxide, Carbon dioxide and Hydrogen Fluoride during combustion. When fire fighting conditions are severe and total thermal decomposition of the product is possible, wear full protective clothing, including helmet, self-contained, positive pressure or pressure demand breathing apparatus, bunker coat and pants, bands around arms, waist and legs, face mask, and protective covering for exposed areas of the head. Move containers from fire area if you can do so without risk. After following product recovery, flush area with water.  Avoid discharge into drains, water courses or onto the ground. Environmental precautions.  Dispose of contents/ container in accordance with the local/regional/national/international regulations. The substrate that was abraded must be considered as a factor in the disposal method for this product. Dispose of waste product in a permitted industrial waste facility. As a disposal alternative, incinerate in a permitted waste incineration facility. Proper destruction may require the use of additional fuel during incineration processes. Combustion products will include halogen acid', ['../docs/31.1 SDS_3M Abrasive Products, 341D Belts.pdf3M™Abrasive Products, 341D Belts    03/14/14\n__________________________________________________________________________________________\n  Page  2 of    1024% of the mixture consists of ingredients of unknown acute oral toxicity.\nSECTION 3: Composition/information on ingredients\nIngredient C.A.S.

In addition, toxicological data on ingredients m ay not be \nreflected in the m aterial clas sification and/or the signs and symptoms of exposure, because an ingredient may be \npresent below the threshold for labeling, an ingredient may not be available for exposure, or the data m ay not be \nrelevant to the m aterial as a whole.\n11.1. Inform ation on Toxicological effects\nSigns and Sympto ms of Exposure\nBased on test data and/or inform ation on the components, this m aterial may produce the following health effects:\nInhalation:\nDust from grinding, sanding or machining may cause irritation of the respir atory system. Signs/symptoms may include cough, \nsneezing, nasal discharge, headache, hoarseness, and nose and throat pain.\nSkin Contact:\nMechanical Skin irritation: Signs/symptoms may include abrasion, redness, pain, and itching.\nEye Contact:\nMechanical eye irritation: Signs/symptoms may include pain, redness, tearing and corneal abrasion.   \nDust created by grinding, sanding, or machining may cause eye irritation. Signs/symptoms may include redness, swelling, \npain, tearing, and blurred or hazy vision.\nIngestion:\nNo health effects are expected.\nCarcinogenicity:\nIngredient C.A.S.

For complete assessment, when determining the degree of hazard, the material \nbeing abraded must also be considered.\nThis product contains titanium dioxide. Cancer of the lungs has been observed in rats that inhale d high levels of titanium \ndioxide.  No exposure to inhaled titanium dioxide is expected during the normal handling and use of this product.  Titanium \ndioxide w as not detected when air sampling was conducted during simulated use of similar products containi ng titanium \ndioxide.
