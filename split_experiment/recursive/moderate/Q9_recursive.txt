Question: Provide a risk assessment for handling and storing large quantities of Copper Sulphate.
Answer: [" Answer: Copper Sulphate is harmful if swallowed, causes skin irritation, serious eye irritation, respiratory irritation, and may cause damage to organs through prolonged or repeated exposure. It is important to wear protective gloves, protective clothing, eye protection, and face protection when handling Copper Sulphate. Do not breathe dust/fume/gas/mist/vapors/spray. Use only outdoors or in a well-ventilated area. If you feel unwell, get medical attention/advice. If inhaled, remove victim to fresh air and keep at rest in a position comfortable for breathing. If on skin, wash with plenty of soap and water. If skin irritation occurs, get medical advice/attention. If in eyes, rinse cautiously with water for several minutes. Remove contact lenses, if present and easy to do. Continue rinsing. If eye irritation persists, get medical advice/attention. If swallowed, call a POISON CENTER or doctor/physician if you feel unwell. Rinse mouth. Store in a well-ventilated place. Keep container tightly closed. Store locked up. Dispose of contents/container to an approved waste disposal plant. Copper Sulphate is very toxic to aquatic life with long-lasting effects. \n\nContext: ['../docs/8.1", ['../docs/8.1 SDS COPPER SULFATE.pdf______________________________________________________________________________________________Cupric sulfate pentahydrate Revision Date  12-Aug-2014\nHazard Statements\nHarmful if swallowed\nCauses skin irritation\nCauses serious eye irritation\nMay cause respiratory irritation\nMay cause damage to organs through prolonged or repeated exposure\nPrecautionary Statements\nPrevention\nWash face, hands and any exposed skin thoroughly after handling\nDo not eat, drink or smoke when using this product\nWear protective gloves/protective clothing/eye protection/face protection\nDo not breathe dust/fume/gas/mist/vapors/spray\nUse only outdoors or in a well-ventilated area\nResponse\nGet medical attention/advice if you feel unwell\nInhalation\nIF INHALED: Remove victim to fresh air and keep at rest in a position comfortable for breathing\nCall a POISON CENTER or doctor/physician if you feel unwell\nSkin\nIF ON SKIN: Wash with plenty of soap and water\nIf skin irritation occurs: Get medical advice/attention\nTake off contaminated clothing and wash before reuse\nEyes\nIF IN EYES: Rinse cautiously with water for several minutes.
