Question: Evaluate the environmental impact of Citrisurf when released in large quantities.
Answer: [' Answer: When spilled on land it is apt to volatilize, biodegrade, and leach into the ground water, but no data on the rates of these processes could be found. Its fate in ground water is unknown. When released into water it will volatilize and probably biodegrade. It would not be expected to adsorb to sediment or bioconcentrate in fish. When released to the atmosphere it will photodegrade in hours (polluted urban atmosphere) to an estimated range of 4 to 6 days in less polluted areas. Rainout should be significant.  None of the chemicals are on the Health & Safety Reporting List.  Chemical waste generators must determine whether a discarded chemical is classified as a hazardous waste. US EPA guidelines for the classification determination are listed in 40 CFR Parts 261.3. Additionally, waste generators must consult state and local hazardous waste regulations to ensure complete and accurate classification.  RCRA P -Series:  None listed.  RCRA U -Series:  None listed.  Very toxic to aquatic life with long lasting effects.  Dispose of contents/container to an approved waste disposal plant.  Store in a well-ventilated place. Keep container tightly closed. Store locked up.
