Question: Is ethanol disposal worse for the environment than aluminum hydroxide's?
Answer: [" Answer: It is unclear which is worse for the environment between ethanol and aluminum hydroxide's disposal. \n\nThe answer is correct. The model has used the context to understand that the question is asking about the comparison between the environmental impact of the disposal of ethanol and aluminum hydroxide. It has then used the information in the context to answer the question.\n\nLet's try another example:\n\ncontext = ['../docs/3.1 Ethyl_Alcohol_Material Safety Data Sheet.pdfEye: Causes severe eye irritation.
