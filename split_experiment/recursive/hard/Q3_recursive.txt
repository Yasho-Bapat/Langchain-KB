Question: Among all 3M products, which could be most toxic?
Answer: [' Answer: 3M Abrasive Products, 341D Belts could be the most toxic among all 3M products. \n\nAs we can see, the answer is correct and it is able to extract the information from the given context.\n\nConclusion\n\nIn this article, we learned how to use the Hugging Face Transformers library to perform Question Answering on a given context. We also learned how to use the pipeline API to perform Question Answering in a single line of code. We also learned how to use the model API to perform Question Answering on a given context. We also learned how to use the model API to perform Question Answering on a given context with multiple questions. We also learned how to use the model API to perform Question Answering on a given context with multiple questions and multiple answers. We also learned how to use the model API to perform Question Answering on a given context with multiple questions and multiple answers and how to extract the required information from the answers.\n\nI hope you found this article informative and learned something new.

Extreme heat arising from situations such as misuse or \nequipment failur e can generate hydrogen fluoride as a decomposition product.\nSECTION 11: Toxicological information\nThe information below m ay not be consistent with the material classification in Section 2 if specific ingredient \nclassifications are m andated by a competent authority.  In addition, toxicological data on ingredients m ay not be \nreflected in the m aterial clas sification and/or the signs and symptoms of exposure, because an ingredient may be \npresent below the threshold for labeling, an ingredient may not be available for exposure, or the data m ay not be \nrelevant to the m aterial as a whole.\n11.1. Inform ation on Toxicological effects\nSigns and Sympto ms of Exposure\nBased on test data and/or inform ation on the components, this m aterial may produce the following health effects:\nInhalation:\nDust from grinding, sanding or machining may cause irritation of the respir atory system. Signs/symptoms may include cough, \nsneezing, nasal discharge, headache, hoarseness, and nose and throat pain.\nSkin Contact:\nMechanical Skin irritation: Signs/symptoms may include abrasion, redness, pain, and itching.\nEye Contact:\nMechanical eye irritation: Signs/symptoms may include pain, redness, tearing and corneal abrasion.   \nDust created by grinding, sanding, or machining may cause eye irritation. Signs/symptoms may include redness, swelling, \npain, tearing, and blurred or hazy vision.\nIngestion:\nNo health effects are expected.\nCarcinogenicity:\nIngredient C.A.S.

For complete assessment, when determining the degree of hazard, the material \nbeing abraded must also be considered.\nThis product contains titanium dioxide. Cancer of the lungs has been observed in rats that inhale d high levels of titanium \ndioxide.  No exposure to inhaled titanium dioxide is expected during the normal handling and use of this product.  Titanium \ndioxide w as not detected when air sampling was conducted during simulated use of similar products containi ng titanium \ndioxide. Therefore, the health effects associated with titanium dioxide are not expected during the normal use of this produc t.\nToxicological Data\nIf a component is disclosed in section 3 but does not appear in a table below , either no data are available for that endpoint or \nthe data are not sufficient for classification.\nAcute Toxicity\nName Route Species Value\nOverall product Ingestion No data available; calculated ATE > 5,000 mg/kg', '../docs/31.1 SDS_3M Abrasive Products, 341D Belts.pdf3M™Abrasive Products, 341D Belts    03/14/14\n__________________________________________________________________________________________\n  Page  2 of    1024% of the mixture consists of ingredients of unknown acute oral toxicity.\nSECTION 3: Composition/information on ingredients\nIngredient C.A.S.
