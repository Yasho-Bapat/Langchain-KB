In addition, toxicological data on ingredients m ay not be \nreflected in the m aterial clas sification and/or the signs and symptoms of exposure, because an ingredient may be \npresent below the threshold for labeling, an ingredient may not be available for exposure, or the data m ay not be \nrelevant to the m aterial as a whole.\n11.1. Inform ation on Toxicological effects\nSigns and Sympto ms of Exposure\nBased on test data and/or inform ation on the components, this m aterial may produce the following health effects:\nInhalation:\nDust from grinding, sanding or machining may cause irritation of the respir atory system. Signs/symptoms may include cough, \nsneezing, nasal discharge, headache, hoarseness, and nose and throat pain.\nSkin Contact:\nMechanical Skin irritation: Signs/symptoms may include abrasion, redness, pain, and itching.\nEye Contact:\nMechanical eye irritation: Signs/symptoms may include pain, redness, tearing and corneal abrasion.   \nDust created by grinding, sanding, or machining may cause eye irritation. Signs/symptoms may include redness, swelling, \npain, tearing, and blurred or hazy vision.\nIngestion:\nNo health effects are expected.\nCarcinogenicity:\nIngredient C.A.S.

For complete assessment, when determining the degree of hazard, the material \nbeing abraded must also be considered.\nThis product contains titanium dioxide. Cancer of the lungs has been observed in rats that inhale d high levels of titanium \ndioxide.  No exposure to inhaled titanium dioxide is expected during the normal handling and use of this product.  Titanium \ndioxide w as not detected when air sampling was conducted during simulated use of similar products containi ng titanium \ndioxide. Therefore, the health effects associated with titanium dioxide are not expected during the normal use of this produc t.\nToxicological Data\nIf a component is disclosed in section 3 but does not appear in a table below , either no data are available for that endpoint or \nthe data are not sufficient for classification.\nAcute Toxicity\nName Route Species Value\nOverall product Ingestion No data available; calculated ATE > 5,000 mg/kg', '../docs/31.1 SDS_3M Abrasive Products, 341D Belts.pdf3M™Abrasive Products, 341D Belts    03/14/14\n__________________________________________________________________________________________\n  Page  7 of    10Aluminum Oxide Mineral (non -fibrous) Dermal LD50 e stimated to be >  5,000 mg/kg\nAluminum Oxide Mineral (non -fibrous) Inhalation -\nDust/Mist \n(4 hours)Rat LC50 > 2.3 mg/l\nAluminum Oxide Mineral (non -fibrous) Ingestion Rat LD50 > 5,000 mg/kg\nFiller Dermal LD50 estimated to be >  5,000 mg/kg\nFiller Ingestion LD50 estimated to be 2,000 -5,000 mg/kg\nInorganic Fluoride Dermal Rabbit LD50 > 2,100 mg/kg\nInorganic Fluoride Inhalation -\nDust/Mist \n(4 hours)Rat LC50  4.5 mg/l\nInorganic Fluoride Ingestion Rat LD50  5,000 mg/kg\nTitanium Dioxide Dermal Rabbit LD50 > 10,000 mg/kg\nTitanium Dioxide Inhalation -\nDust/Mist \n(4 hours)Rat LC50 > 6.82 mg/l\nTitanium Dioxide Ingestion Rat LD50 > 10,000 mg/kg\nFiller Dermal Rat LD50 > 2,000 mg/kg\nFiller Inhalation -\nDust/Mist \n(4 hours)Rat LC50  3.0 mg/l\nFiller Ingestion Rat LD50  6,450 mg/kg\nATE = acute toxicity estimate\nSkin Corrosion/Irritation\nName Species Value\nAluminum Oxide Mineral (non -fibrous) Rabbit No significant irritation\nInorganic Fluoride Minimal irritation\nTitanium Dioxide Rabbit No significant irritation\nFiller Rabbit No significant irritation\nSerious Eye Damage/Irritation\nName Species Value\nAluminum Oxide Mineral (non -fibrous) Rabbit No significant irritation\nInorganic Fluoride Moderate irritant\nTitanium Dioxide Rabbit No significant irritation\nFiller Rabbit No significant irritation\nSkin Sensitization\nName Species Value\nTitanium Dioxide Human \nand \nanimalNot sensitizing\nRespiratory Sensitization\nName Species Value\nGerm Cell Mutagenicity\nName Route Value\nAluminum Oxide Mineral (non -fibrous) In Vitro Not mutagenic\nFiller In Vitro Not mutagenic\nTitanium Dioxide In Vitro Not mutagenic\nTitanium Dioxide In vivo Not mutagenic\nCarcinogenicity\nName Route Species Value\nAluminum Oxide Mineral (non -fibrous) Inhalation Rat Not carcinogenic\nTitanium Dioxide Ingestion Multiple \nanimal \nspeciesNot carcinogenic\nTitanium Dioxide Inhalation Rat Carcinogenic', '../docs/11.1 SDS ROUND COMBINATION BENCH STONE 4 X 1 IB64 Treat-Oil Filled 61463685545.pdfCarcinogens:\n\xa0  ACGIH   NIOSH   OSHA   IARC   NTP      MEXICO\nAluminum Oxide,\nNon-fibrous    A4 Not\nClassifiable as a\nHuman\nCarcinogen No Data  No Data  No Data  No Data\xa0 A4 Not\nClassifiable as a\nHuman\nCarcinogen\nAmorphous Silica, Fused    No Data  NIOSH\ncarcinogen No Data  No Data  No Data\xa0 No Data\nTitanium dioxide    No Data  No Data  No Data  No Data  No Data\xa0 A4 Not\nClassifiable as a\nHuman\nCarcinogen\nAluminum Oxide, Non-fibrous :\nRTECS Number: BD1200000\nInhalation: Inhalation - Rat TCLo: 200 mg/m3/5H/28W (Intermittent) [Lungs, Thorax, or Respiration - Structural or\nfunctional change in trachea or bronchi; Lungs, Thorax, or Respiration - Chronic pulmonary edema;\nRelated to Chronic Data - death] (RTECS)\nAmorphous Silica, Fused :\nRTECS Number: "VV7328000"\nInhalation: Inhalation - Rat TCLo: 197 mg/m3/6H/26W (Intermittent) [Lungs, Thorax, !or Respiration - Changes in\nlung weight] (RTECS)\nTitanium dioxide :\nRTECS Number: "XR2275000"\nSkin: Skin - Human Standard Draize test. : 300 ug/3D-I - [mild] (RTECS)\nInhalation: Inhalation - Rat TCLo - Lowest published toxic concentration: 1 mg/kg - [Lungs, Thorax, or Respiration -\nOther changes Biochemical - Metabolism (Intermediary) - Effect on inflammation or mediation of\ninflammation ] (RTECS)\nIngestion: Oral - Rodent rat TDLo - Lowest published toxic dose: 60 gm/kg - [Gastrointestinal - Hypermotility,\ndiarrhea Gastrointestinal - Other changes ] (RTECS)\nSECTION 12 : ECOLOGICAL INFORMATION\nEcotoxicity: \nEcotoxicity: Please contact the phone number or address of the manufacturer listed in Section 1 for information on\necotoxicity.\nSECTION 13 : DISPOSAL CONSIDERATIONS\nDescription of waste: \nWaste Disposal: Consult with the US EPA Guidelines listed in 40 CFR Part 261.3 for the classifications of hazardous waste\nprior to disposal.
