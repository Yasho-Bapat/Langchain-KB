Exposure controls\n8.2.1. Engineering controls\nFor those situations where the material might be exposed to extreme overheating due to misuse or equipment failure, use with \nappropriate local exhaust ventilation sufficient to maintain levels of thermal decomposition products below their exposure \nguideline s.  Provide appropriate local exhaust ventilation for sanding, grinding or machining.  Use general dilution ventilation \nand/or local exhaust ventilation to control airborne exposures to below relevant Exposure Limits and/or control \ndust/fume/gas/mist/vapor s/spray. If ventilation is not adequate, use respiratory protection equipment.  Provide local exhaust at \nprocess emission sources to control exposure near the source and to prevent the escape of dust into the work area.  Ensure th at \ndust-handling systems ( such as exhaust ducts, dust collectors, vessels, and processing equipment) are designed in a manner to \nprevent the escape of dust into the w ork area (i.e., there is no leakage from the equipment).\n8.2.2. Personal protective equipment (PPE)\nEye/face prote ction\nTo minimize the risk of injury to face and eyes, always wear eye and face protection when working at sanding or grinding \noperations or when near such operations.
