Exposure controls\n8.2.1. Engineering controls\nFor those situations where the material might be exposed to extreme overheating due to misuse or equipment failure, use with \nappropriate local exhaust ventilation sufficient to maintain levels of thermal decomposition products below their exposure \nguideline s. Provide appropriate local exhaust ventilation for sanding, grinding or machining. Use general dilution ventilation \nand/or local exhaust ventilation to control airborne exposures to below relevant Exposure Limits and/or control \ndust/fume/gas/mist/vapor s/spray. If ventilation is not adequate, use respiratory protection equipment. Provide local exhaust at \nprocess emission sources to control exposure near the source and to prevent the escape of dust into the work area. Ensure th at \ndust-handling systems ( such as exhaust ducts, dust collectors, vessels, and processing equipment) are designed in a manner to \nprevent the escape of dust into the w ork area (i.e., there is no leakage from the equipment). 8.2.2. Personal protective equipment (PPE)\nEye/face prote ction\nTo minimize the risk of injury to face and eyes, always wear eye and face protection when working at sanding or grinding \noperations or when near such operations. Select and use eye/face protection to prevent contact based on the results of an \nexpos ure assessment. The follow ing eye/face protection(s) are recommended:\nSafety Glasses with side shields\nSkin/hand protection\nWear appropriate gloves to minimize risk of injury to skin from contact with dust or physical abrasion from grinding or \nsanding. Respiratory protection\nAssess exposure concentrations of all materials involved in the w ork process. Consider material being abraded when \ndetermining the appropriate respiratory protection. Select and use appropriate respirators to prevent inhalation overexposure. An exposure assessment may be needed to decide if a respirator is required. If a respirator is needed, use respirators as pa rt of \na full respiratory protection program. Based on the results of the exposure assessment, select from the follo wing respirator \ntype(s) to reduce inhalation exposure:\nHalf facepiece or full facepiece air -purifying respirator suitable for particulates\nFor questions about suitability for a specific application, consult with your respirator manufacturer.

Signs/symptoms may include cough, \nsneezing, nasal discharge, headache, hoarseness, and nose and throat pain. Skin Contact:\nMechanical Skin irritation: Signs/symptoms may include abrasion, redness, pain, and itching. Eye Contact:\nMechanical eye irritation: Signs/symptoms may include pain, redness, tearing and corneal abrasion. Dust created by grinding, sanding, or machining may cause eye irritation. Signs/symptoms may include redness, swelling, \npain, tearing, and blurred or hazy vision. Ingestion:\nNo health effects are expected. Carcinogenicity:\nIngredient C.A.S.

If ventilation is not adequate, use respiratory protection equipment.

Personal protective equipment (PPE)\nEye/face protection\nTo minimize the risk of injury to face and eyes, always wear eye and face protection when working at sanding or grinding \noperations or when near such operations. Select and use eye/face protection to prevent contact based on the results of an \nexposure assessment. The follow ing eye/face protection(s) are recommended:\nSafety Glasses with side shields\nSkin/hand protection\nWear appropriate gloves to minimize risk of injury to skin from cont act with dust or physical abrasion from grinding or \nsanding. Respiratory protection\nAssess exposure concentrations of all materials involved in the w ork process. Consider material being abraded when \ndetermining the appropriate respiratory protection. Select and use appropriate respirators to prevent inhalation overexposure. An exposure assessment may be needed to decide if a respirator is required. If a respirator is needed, use respirators as part of \na full respiratory protection program. Based on the results of the exposure assessment, select from the following respirator \ntype(s) to reduce inhalation exposure:\nHalf facepiece or full facepiece air -purifying respirator suitable for particulates\nFor questions about suitability for a specific application, consult with your respirator manufacturer.",

Section 4 - First Aid Measures  \n \n \nEyes:  Get medical aid. Gently lift e yelids and flush continuously with wate r. Skin:  Get medical aid. Wash clothing before reuse. Flush skin with plenty of soap and \nwater. Ingestion:  Do not induce vomiting. If victim is conscious and alert, give 2 -4 cupfuls of milk \nor water. Never give anyth ing by mouth to an unconscious person. Get medical aid. Inhalation:  Remove from exposure and move to fresh air immediately. If not breathing, \ngive artificial respiration. If breathing is difficult, give oxygen. Get medical aid. Do NOT use \nmouth -to-mouth re suscitation. Notes to Physician:  Treat symptomatically and supportively. Persons with skin or eye \ndisorders or liver, kidney, chronic respiratory diseases, or central and peripheral nervous \nsytem diseases may be at increased risk from exposure to this subs tance. Antidote:  Replace fluid and electrolytes. Section 5 - Fire Fighting Measures  \n \n \nGeneral Information:  Replace fluid and electrolytes. As in any fire, wear a self -contained \nbreathing apparatus in pressure -demand, MSHA/NIOSH (approved or equivalent), and full \nprotective gear. Vapors may form an explosive mixture with air. Vapors can travel to a \nsource of ignition and flash back. Will burn if involved in a fire. Flammable Liquid. Can \nrelease vapors that form explosive mixtures at temperatures above the flashpoint. Use \nwater spray to keep fire -exposed containers cool. Containers may explode in the heat of a \nfire. Extinguishing Media:  For small fires, use dry chemical, carbon dioxide, water spray or \nalcohol -resistant foam. For large fires, use water spray,  fog, or alcohol -resistant foam. Use \nwater spray to cool fire -exposed containers. Water may be ineffective.",
