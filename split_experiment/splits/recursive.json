Exposure controls\n8.2.1. Engineering controls\nFor those situations where the material might be exposed to extreme overheating due to misuse or equipment failure, use with \nappropriate local exhaust ventilation sufficient to maintain levels of thermal decomposition products below their exposure \nguideline s.  Provide appropriate local exhaust ventilation for sanding, grinding or machining.  Use general dilution ventilation \nand/or local exhaust ventilation to control airborne exposures to below relevant Exposure Limits and/or control \ndust/fume/gas/mist/vapor s/spray. If ventilation is not adequate, use respiratory protection equipment.  Provide local exhaust at \nprocess emission sources to control exposure near the source and to prevent the escape of dust into the work area.  Ensure th at \ndust-handling systems ( such as exhaust ducts, dust collectors, vessels, and processing equipment) are designed in a manner to \nprevent the escape of dust into the w ork area (i.e., there is no leakage from the equipment).\n8.2.2. Personal protective equipment (PPE)\nEye/face prote ction\nTo minimize the risk of injury to face and eyes, always wear eye and face protection when working at sanding or grinding \noperations or when near such operations.  Select and use eye/face protection to prevent contact based on the results of an \nexpos ure assessment.  The follow ing eye/face protection(s) are recommended:\nSafety Glasses with side shields\nSkin/hand protection\nWear appropriate gloves to minimize risk of injury to skin from contact with dust or physical abrasion from grinding or \nsanding.\nRespiratory protection\nAssess exposure concentrations of all materials involved in the w ork process.  Consider material being abraded when \ndetermining the appropriate respiratory protection.  Select and use appropriate respirators to prevent inhalation overexposure.  \nAn exposure assessment may be needed to decide if a respirator is required.  If a respirator is needed, use respirators as pa rt of \na full respiratory protection program.  Based on the results of the exposure assessment, select from the follo wing respirator \ntype(s) to reduce inhalation exposure:\nHalf facepiece or full facepiece air -purifying respirator suitable for particulates\nFor questions about suitability for a specific application, consult with your respirator manufacturer.\nSECTION 9: P hysical and chemical properties",

Ensure that \ndust-handling systems (such as exhaust ducts, dust collectors, vessels, and processing equipment) are designed in a manner to \nprevent the escape of dust into the w ork area (i.e., there is no leakage from the equipment ).\n8.2.2. Personal protective equipment (PPE)\nEye/face protection\nTo minimize the risk of injury to face and eyes, always wear eye and face protection when working at sanding or grinding \noperations or when near such operations.  Select and use eye/face protection to prevent contact based on the results of an \nexposure assessment.  The follow ing eye/face protection(s) are recommended:\nSafety Glasses with side shields\nSkin/hand protection\nWear appropriate gloves to minimize risk of injury to skin from cont act with dust or physical abrasion from grinding or \nsanding.\nRespiratory protection\nAssess exposure concentrations of all materials involved in the w ork process.  Consider material being abraded when \ndetermining the appropriate respiratory protection.  Select and use appropriate respirators to prevent inhalation overexposure.  \nAn exposure assessment may be needed to decide if a respirator is required.  If a respirator is needed, use respirators as part of \na full respiratory protection program.  Based on the results of the exposure assessment, select from the following respirator \ntype(s) to reduce inhalation exposure:\nHalf facepiece or full facepiece air -purifying respirator suitable for particulates\nFor questions about suitability for a specific application, consult with your respirator manufacturer.",

Practice good housekeeping. For industrial orprofessional use only. Always read, understand and follow the Safety Guide insert as well as theSafety Data Sheet before use. Use care when handling and storing abrasive wheels and products.Always inspect products for cracks, chips, nicks and for possible damage before mounting andring test vitrified wheels. Damaged product can break apart during use and cause serious injury.Always use a guard, never exceed maximum operating speed, mount and operate according toANSI B7.1 for Bonded Abrasive products and ANSI B7.7 for Coated Abrasive products.Precautions for safe handling\nStore in tightly closed container. Store in a well-ventilated place. Store away from incompatible\nmaterials (see Section 10 of the SDS).Conditions for safe storage,\nincluding any incompatibilities\nProtective measures\nWear appropriate personal protective equipment (see Section 8). Use only with adequate ventilation. Avoid breathing dust. Read\nthe Safety Data Sheet of the material you are grinding, polishing, cutting, sanding, etc. for appropriate respiratory protectio n.\nWash hands after handling\nStorage conditions\nBonded Abrasive products should be stored according to ANSI B7.1 and not be exposed to extreme temperatures or conditions\nthat cause condensation. Coated Abrasive products should be stored according to ANSI B7.7 and between 35-50% relativehumidity and between 60-80 degrees Fahrenheit.\n8.
