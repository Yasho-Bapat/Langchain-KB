Question: What equipment is recommended while manufacturing scotch brite and what care should be taken while handling the involved material?
Answer:  Answer: Provide appropriate local exhaust ventilation for sanding, grinding or machining.  Use general dilution ventilation and/or local exhaust ventilation to control airborne exposures to below relevant Exposure Limits and/or control dust/fume/gas/mist/vapors/spray. If ventilation is not adequate, use respiratory protection equipment.  Provide local exhaust at process emission sources to control exposure near the source and to prevent the escape of dust into the work area.  Ensure that dust-handling systems (such as exhaust ducts, dust collectors, vessels, and processing equipment) are designed in a manner to prevent the escape of dust into the work area (i.e., there is no leakage from the equipment ). Eye/face protection To minimize the risk of injury to face and eyes, always wear eye and face protection when working at sanding or grinding operations or when near such operations.  Select and use eye/face protection to prevent contact based on the results of an exposure assessment.  The following eye/face protection(s) are recommended: Safety Glasses with side shields Skin/hand protection Wear appropriate gloves to minimize risk of injury to skin from contact with dust or physical abrasion from grinding or sanding. Respiratory protection Assess exposure concentrations of all materials involved in the work process.  Consider material
