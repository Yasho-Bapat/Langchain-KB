Use a NIOSH/MSHA or European Standard EN 149 approved respirator if exposure limits are exceeded or if irritation or other symptoms are experienced. Handle in accordance with good industrial hygiene and safety practice. Store in a well-ventilated place. Keep container tightly closed. Collect spillage. Sweep up or vacuum up spillage and collect in suitable container for disposal. Keep in suitable, closed containers for disposal. Ensure adequate ventilation. Use personal protective equipment.
