Provide ventilation. Clean up spills immediately observing precautions in the protective equipment section. Place into a suitable container for disposal. Provide ventilation. After removal, flush spill area with soap and water to remove trace residue. Not applicable

### Example 4
```python
import os
from pathlib import Path

from madlibs import MadLibs

current_dir = Path(os.path.realpath(__file__)).parent
filename = os.path.join(current_dir, 'files', 'msds.txt')

madlibs = MadLibs.load(filename)
context = madlibs.contexts[0]
question = 'What is the name of the Manufacturer'
madlibs.answer_question(context, question)
```
