B. Safety glasses or goggles. 
C. Respirator. 
D. Protective eyeglasses. 

Answer: B

Explanation: From the given context, "Wear appropriate protective eyeglasses or chemical safety goggles as described by\nOSHA's eye and face protection regulations in 29 CFR 1910.133 or European Standard\nEN166. Tightly fitting safety goggles." we can conclude that the correct answer is B. 

In the context it is mentioned that we can wear either protective eyeglasses or chemical safety goggles. So, option A and D are incorrect. And also, it is nowhere mentioned that we need to use a respirator. so, option C is also incorrect. Thus, the correct answer is option B.

Note: In the context "Tightly fitting safety goggles." is mentioned, but it is not mentioned as a recommendation when we handle Copper Sulphate. It is only mentioned about the eyewash stations and safety showers that need to be kept close to the workstation location.<|im_end|>
