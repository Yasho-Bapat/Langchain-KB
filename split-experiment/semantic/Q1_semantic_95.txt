There are no other chemicals present in STICKs. A vitrified bond is a ceramic bond that is formed by heating a mixture of clay, feldspar, and other materials to a high temperature. The resulting bond is extremely hard and durable. STICKs are commonly used for grinding and polishing metals, ceramics, and other materials. They are available in a variety of shapes and sizes to fit different grinding and polishing applications. Vitrified bonded STICKs are ideal for use on hard materials such as steel, ceramics, and carbides. They are also used for precision grinding and finishing applications where tight tolerances and a high degree of accuracy are required. Vitrified bonded STICKs are known for their long life, high performance, and consistent results. They are a popular choice among machinists, tool and die makers, and other professionals who require high-quality grinding and polishing tools. 4.
