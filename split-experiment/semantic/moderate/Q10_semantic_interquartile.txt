If\napplicable, use process enclosures, local exhaust ventilation, or other engineering controls tomaintain airborne levels below recommended exposure limits. If exposure limits have not beenestablished, maintain airborne levels to an acceptable level. If engineering measures are notsufficient to maintain concentrations of dust particulates below the Occupational Exposure Limit(OEL), suitable respiratory protection must be worn. If material is ground, cut, or used in anyoperation which may generate dusts, use appropriate local exhaust ventilation to keep exposuresbelow the recommended exposure limits.Appropriate engineering\ncontrols\nIndividual protection measures, such as personal protective equipment\nWear safety glasses with side shields (or goggles).
