It may cause damage to organs through prolonged or repeated exposure. It is classified as an acute oral toxicity Category 4, skin corrosion/irritation Category 2, serious eye damage/eye irritation Category 2, and specific target organ toxicity (single exposure) Category 3. It is also classified as specific target organ toxicity (repeated exposure) Category 2. It is toxic to aquatic organisms and may cause long-term adverse effects in the aquatic environment.
