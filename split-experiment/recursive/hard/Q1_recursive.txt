Question: Are there any commonalities between scotch brite and havaklean KP? Which of them could be more dangerous in manufacturing?
Answer:  

Scotch Brite and Havaklean KP are two different products that cannot be compared in terms of danger. Scotch Brite is a non-reactive product that is considered safe under normal use conditions. Havaklean KP, on the other hand, is not mentioned in this context and therefore cannot be compared to Scotch Brite.
