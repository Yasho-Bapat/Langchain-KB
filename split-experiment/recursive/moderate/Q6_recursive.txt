Question: If I live in Quebec, how much aluminum oxide can I come in contact with? What do I do if it accidentally goes into my eyes?
Answer:  

If you live in Quebec, you can come in contact with 10 mg/m3 of Aluminum Oxide, Non-fibrous. If it accidentally goes into your eyes, you should immediately flush your eyes with plenty of water for at least 15 to 20 minutes. Ensure adequate flushing of the eyes by separating the eyelids with fingers. Remove contacts if present and easy to do. Continue rinsing. Get medical attention, if irritation or symptoms of overexposure persists.<|im_end|>
