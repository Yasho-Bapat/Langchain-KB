Answer:  Answer: When 341D catches fire, use a fire fighting agent suitable for ordinary combustible material such as water or foam to extinguish. Exposure to extreme heat can give rise to thermal decomposition. Substance Condition Carbon monoxide During Combustion Carbon dioxide During Combustion Hydrogen Fluoride During Combustion. When fire fighting conditions are severe and total thermal decomposition of the product is possible, wear full protective clothing, including helmet, self-contained, positive pressure or pressure demand breathing apparatus, bunker coat and pants, bands around arms, waist and legs, face mask, and protective covering for exposed areas of the head. After the fire has been extinguished, clean up spills immediately observing precautions in the protective equipment section. Place into a suitable container for disposal. Provide ventilation.
